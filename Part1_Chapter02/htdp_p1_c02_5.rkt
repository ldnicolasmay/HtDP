;; 2.5 Programs

; Two distinct kinds of programs:
;   1. batch program - consumes all it's inputs at once and computes its result
;   2. interactive program - consumes some of its inputs, computes, produces
;      some output, consumes more input, and so on.

; (require 2htdp/batch-io) adds (read-file ...) and (write-file ...) functions

; (write-file "sample.dat" "212")
; (read-file "sample.dat")

; (write-file 'stdout "212\n")

(define (C f)
  (* 5/9 (- f 32)))

                (C
                 (string->number
                  (read-file in))))
               "\n")))
; (convert "sample.dat" 'stdout)
; (convert "sample.dat" "sample_out.dat")
; (read-file "sample_out.dat")


;;; Exercise 31

; (write-file 'stdout (letter "Matthew" "Fisler" "Felleisen"))

  (write-file out
              (letter (read-file in-fst)

                      (read-file in-signature))))

;;; Exercise 32
; Most people no longer use desktop computers just to run applications but
; also employ cell phones, tablets, and their carsâ€™ information control screen.
; Soon people will use wearable computers in the form of intelligent glasses,
; clothes, and sports gear. In the somewhat more distant future, people may
; come with built-in bio computers that directly interact with body functions.
; Think of ten different forms of events that software applications on such
; computers will have to deal with.
; 1.  blood pressure measures
; 2.  heart rate
; 3.  eletrical brain activity
; 4.  body fluid chemistry metrics
; 5.  vaso-constriction metrics
; 6.  body sweat
; 7.  body temperature
; 8.  respiration rate
; 9.
; 10.
