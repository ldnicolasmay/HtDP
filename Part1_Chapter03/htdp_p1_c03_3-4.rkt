; Chapter 3 How to Design Programs


;; 3.3 Domain Knowledge

; There are two forms of domain knowledge:
; 1. Knowledge from exterinal domains, such as mathematics, music, biology, etc.
; 2. Knowledge about the library functions in the chosen programming language.
;    Like if you need to do some job that involves calculating the tangent of an
;    angle, then you need to know that your programming language offers a
;    a function like Racket's (tan ...).


;; 3.4 From Functions to Programs

; As a program relies on more and more functions, it's good to keep a function
; wish list. Each wish list entry should contain 3 things:
;   1. meaningful name for the function
;   2. function signature
;   3. function purpose statement
;
; As long as the wish list isn't empty, pick a wish and design the function.
; As needed, add more functions to the wish list. When the list is empty,
; you're done
